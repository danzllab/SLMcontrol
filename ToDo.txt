ToDo
-   fix AutoAlign button (single pass)

-   remove vector diffraction from SLM control, instead load VD as package 
    (redundant structures)

-   better package management (only load what's needed)
    - SLM control w/o auto align does not need machine learning or vector diffraction

-   extra params file for simulation?
    - no need to change SLM geometry when simulating data for ML

-   declutter main!
    - remove all autoalignment routines. into microscope class?
    - remove update routines?
    - initialisation?

-   clean up machine learning
    - track down hardcoded bits
    - redundant bits / duplicate code
    
-    use simulation mode for training data generation
